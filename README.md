# Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence – Mini Projects

## Overview
This repository contains five academic mini-projects developed in C# as part of the *Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence* module. Each project demonstrates the practical implementation of core AI concepts, including computation theory, rule-based systems, fuzzy inference, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

## Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Turing Machine
Implementation of a simplified Turing Machine simulator demonstrating state transitions and tape-based computation.

### 2️⃣ Rule-Based Flying System
A rule-based decision system that evaluates flight conditions and applies logical rules to determine outcomes.

### 3️⃣ Fuzzy Logic System
Implementation of a fuzzy inference system using membership functions and rule evaluation.

### 4️⃣ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
A basic NLP mini-project demonstrating text processing and simple language analysis techniques.

### 5️⃣ Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning
Implementation of a Q-Learning algorithm demonstrating reinforcement learning principles and reward-based state updates.
