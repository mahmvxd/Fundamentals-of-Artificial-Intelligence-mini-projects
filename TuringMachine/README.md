This project implements a simplified Turing Machine simulator in C#. It demonstrates state transitions, tape manipulation, and computational logic based on theoretical computer science principles.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- State-based computation
- Tape simulation
- Transition functions
- Deterministic logic execution

## Technologies
- C#
- .NET Console Application

## Academic Context
Developed as part of the Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence module.
